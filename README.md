# Autoclicker (by David Golunski)
A small plugin that allows you to control an Autoclicker from the Streamdeck.  
You can simulate left, middle and right mouse button clicks with a custom delay.


## Troubleshooting
- __The Delay is showing "0":__  
When setting the delay it is important that you input an integer (whole number) between 0 and 9999.   
If you have a "." or a letter inside the number the program will default to the delay to 0

- __The Autoclicker does not work in my Game:__  
Programs and games sometimes try to find out if a mouse click was a "real" mouse click or a simulated one.  
If the game or program really wants to prevent autoclickers it usually will do so :(
